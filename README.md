Or you can follow these steps to run the codebase on your local server:
1. Fork & clone this repository
2. `npm i` or `npm install` to update and download the latest dependencies
3. Users should have or create a `.env` file and set these variables:

   > VITE_PORT=https://serial-killa-foreal.onrender.com
   > VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:[your port that the backend will run on] -

   You can see instructions for the backend here [_Cereal Killahs Backend_](https://github.com/anickacodes/Cereal-Killahs-BackEnd/)

4. `npm run dev` to start up the server. Make sure the API variable in `CerealDetails.jsx`, `Cereals.jsx`, `CerealEditForm.jsx`, `CerealNewForm.jsx` matches the correct env.
